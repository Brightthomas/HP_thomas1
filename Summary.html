     <b>DOMAIN NAME SERVER</b>
     <p>
     Domain Name Server (DNS) is a standard protocol that helps Internet users discover websites using human
     readable addresses. Like a phonebook which lets you look up the name of a person and discover their number,
     DNS lets you type the address of a website and automatically discover the Internet Protocol (IP) address for that
     website. It is the system that is used to translate human-memorable domain names like namecheap.com and
     hostnames like support.namecheap.com into the corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as well
     as to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.
     <p>
     Without DNS, the Internet would collapse - it would be impossible for people and machines to access Internet
     servers via the friendly URLs they have come to know.
     <p>
     For example, the domain name www.ns1.com you are viewing now, translates to the IP address 104.20.48.182 (in
     the old IPv4 format) or 2002:6814:30b6:0:0:0:0:0 (in the newer IPv6 format).
     <p>
     <b>Different Types of Domains Available</b><p>
     Now that you have a better understanding of what domain names are and how they work, let’s dive into the types
     of domain names that are available for you to register.<p>
     When most people think of a website, they usually think of the standard ‘.com.’ Even though this is the most
     common extension, there are multiple different types of extensions available.<p>
     In fact, there are five different types of domains available to you. Some won’t be available to you unless you’re
     running a particular kind of website, but we cover this in detail below.<p>
     <b>1. Top-Level Domains</b><p>
     Top-level domains are at the top of the internet hierarchy of domain names. You’ll see these commonly referred
     to as TLDs. There are over thousands of different TLDs available. In recent years ICANN opened up new TLD
     registration and approval, so companies and individuals could pitch and register unique TLDs. This sent the
     number of TLDs available soaring.<p>
     Here’s a full list of the top-level TLDs currently available to register, and here’s just a few of the ones we offer for
     registration here at HostGator:

  <br>
  Keep in mind that when you’re choosing a top-level domain for your domain, you’ll want to choose one that’s in 

alignment with, or enhances, your brand and overall domain. Just because a particular TLD is available, it doesn’t 

mean you should register it. A lot of TLDs are more like vanity extensions vs. something you should use for the 
foundation of your site.<p>
<b>2. Country Code Top Level Domains</b><p>
Next, on the list, we have country code top-level domains (ccTLD). As the name suggests, these are technically 
tied to different countries. Each country has its own ccTLD, but you don’t have to use one, just because you live 
in a specific country.<p>
For example, the ccTLD .co is technically for websites based out of Colombia, but it’s commonly used by internet 
startups, like AND.CO.
<p>
These domain extensions can be useful if you’re building a website in a specific country and want to signal to your 
visitors that they’ve come to the right place. For example, websites based out of the US can use the ‘.us’ extension, 
while companies from Japan can use the ‘.jp’ extension.
<p>
<b>3. Generic Top-Level Domains</b>
<p>
Next, we’ve got generic top-level domains (gTLDs). This is more of a definition than an actual type of domain. As 
the description suggests, it’s just a different variation of a TLD. So, you could technically classify this type of domain 
as a TLD as well.<p>
The generic aspect of this domain extension refers to the types of use-cases that these domains are intended for.<p>
Let’s look at an example. Military organizations can use the ‘.mil’ extension, while educational institutions can use 
the ‘.edu,’ and ‘.org’ is intended for use by non-profit organizations.
<p>
  A lot of gTLDs can be registered even if you don’t satisfy the requirements, but for some like ‘.mil’ and ‘.edu’ you
  must fit the requirements.<p>
  Here’s a full list of the current gTLDs that are available to register.<p>
  <b>4. Second-Level Domains</b><p>
  Second-level domains are below the TLDs highlighted above in terms of hierarchy. This doesn’t mean they’re any
  less authoritative, or valuable. Rather, this describes the second piece of the domain name, such as the ‘hostgator’
  in ‘www.hostgator.com.’
  <p>
  There are also country code second-level domains, which might look like the following:
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> .co.uk – Companies in the United Kingdom commonly use this.</li>
  <li> .gov.uk – This is used by government agencies throughout the United Kingdom.</li>
  <li> .gov.au – Government agencies across Australia use this.</li></ul>
 <p>
 <b> 5. Third Level Domains</b><p>
  Third level domains are below second-level domains in the domain name hierarchy. They aren’t a full domain
  name in and of themselves, but merely a portion of a domain name.<p>
  For example, in the domain name “www.hostgator.com,” ‘www’ would be the third level domain. Or, if you’re
  using a subdomain to build an additional section of your site, this would be a third-level domain as well.<p>
  To have a fully functional domain name you don’t need to have a third-level domain name. For example,
  ‘hostgator.com’ would function just perfectly. Even the ‘www’ that used to be a requirement of domain names is
  no longer necessary.<p>
 <b> DOMAIN SUFFIX</b>
 <p>
The term "dot.com" has become a ubiquitous phrase in the English language. The "dot.com" really refers to the 

domain of a Web site. Sites on the Web are grouped by their URLs according to the type of organization providing 
the information on the site. For example, any commercial enterprise or corporation that has a Web site will have 
a domain suffix of .com, which means it is a commercial entity.
<p>
The domain suffix provides you with a clue about the purpose or audience of a Web site. The domain suffix might 
also give you a clue about the geographic origin of a Web site. Many sites from the United Kingdom will have a 
domain suffix of .uk.
<p>
Here follows a list of the most common domain suffixes and the types of organizations that would use them.<p>
<b>.com</b><br>
Commercial site. The information provided by commercial interests is generally going to shed a positive light on 
the product it promotes. While this information might not necessarily be false, you might be getting only part of 
the picture. Remember, there's a monetary incentive behind every commercial site in providing you with 
information, whether it is for good public relations or to sell you a product outright.<p>
<b>.edu</b><br>
Educational institution. Sites using this domain name are schools ranging from kindergarten to higher education. 
If you take a look at your school's URL you'll notice that it ends with the domain .edu. Information from sites within 
this domain must be examined very carefully. If it is from a department or research center at a educational 
institution, it can generally be taken as credible. However, students' personal Web sites are not usually monitored 
by the school even though they are on the school's server and use the .edu domain.<p>
  <b>.gov</b><br>
  Government. If you come across a site with this domain, then you're viewing a federal government site. All
  branches of the United States federal government use this domain. Information such as Census statistics,
  Congressional hearings, and Supreme Court rulings would be included in sites with this domain. The information
  is considered to be from a credible source.<p>
  <b>.org</b><br>
  Traditionally a non-profit organization. Organizations such as the American Red Cross or PBS (Public Broadcasting
  System) use this domain suffix. Generally, the information in these types of sites is credible and unbiased, but
  there are examples of organizations that strongly advocate specific points of view over others, such as the National 
  Right to Life Committee and Planned Parenthood. You probably want to give this domain a closer scrutiny these
  days. Some commercial interests might be the ultimate sponsors of a site with this suffix.<p>
  <b>.mil</b><br>
  Military. This omain suffix is used by the various branches of the Armed Forces of the United States.<p>
 <b> .net</b><br>
  Network. You might find any kind of site under this domain suffix. It acts as a catch-all for sites that don't fit into
  any of the preceding domain suffixes. Information from these sites should be given careful scrutiny.<p>
    <center><b>THE WORLD WIDE WEB</b></center><p>
    World Wide Web (WWW), byname the Web, the leading information retrieval service of the Internet (the
    worldwide computer network). The Web gives users access to a vast array of documents that are connected to
    each other by means of hypertext or hypermedia links—i.e., hyperlinks, electronic connections that link related
    pieces of information in order to allow a user easy access to them. Hypertext allows the user to select a word or
    phrase from text and thereby access other documents that contain additional information pertaining to that word
    or phrase. Hypermedia documents feature links to images, sounds, animations, and movies. The Web operates
    within the Internet’s basic client-server format; servers are computer programs that store and transmit
    documents to other computers on the network when asked to, while clients are programs that request documents
    from a server as the user asks for them. Browser software allows users to view the retrieved documents.<p>
    A hypertext document with its corresponding text and hyperlinks is written in HyperText Markup
    Language (HTML) and is assigned an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).<p>
     <b> Domain name</b><p>
      The domain name is the most prominent part of a web address. Typically, different pages on the same site will
      continue to use the same domain name. For example, all pages on this site share the GCFLearnFree.org domain
      name.<p>
      <img src="favicon2..jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
      <img src="favicon3..jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
      <p>
        <b>File path</b><p>
        The file path—often just called the path—tells your browser to load a specific page. If you don’t specify a path and
        only enter a domain name, your browser is still loading a specific page; it’s just loading a default page, which
        usually will help you navigate to other pages.

    <p>
        <b>SEARCHING THE INTERNET</b>
        <p>
        <b>1. Vary Your Search Engine</b><p>
        Search engines sort through about 625 million active websites to provide you with content. You may favor one,
        but don't let habit restrict you. No search engine is perfect, and they all have different blind spots. The most widely
        used search engines are Google®, Bing® and Yahoo®.
        <p>
          <ul>
            
        <li> Google usually returns the greatest variety of results, and has by far the largest catalog of pages.</li><p>
        <li> Bing, however, has more extensive autocomplete results (where the search engine tries to narrow the
        search for you).</li><p>
        <li> Yahoo offers search as part of a wider range of services that includes news and shopping. Other engines
        such as DuckDuckGo® and Dogpile® also have their devotees.</li> </ul><p>
       <b> 2. Use Specific Keywords</b><p>
        Keywords are the terms that you use to find content on the internet. Making your keywords as specific as possible
        will help your search engine to track down the information that you want.
   <p>
     Say, for example, that you want to find a local supplier that can design an exhibition stand for your company. If 

you type stand design into your search engine, the results will include many pages about other types of stand, 

whereas typing exhibition stand designer will return a more concise range of companies.
<p>
You can further refine your search by including other specific keywords. If you add your location, for example, 
you'll likely find someone local.
<p>
 <b> 4. Use Quotation Marks</b>
 <p>
  Enclosing a search term within quotation marks prompts the search engine to search for that specific word or
  phrase.<p>
  If the term is a single word, using quotation marks will cut out stemmed variations of it. For example, if you search
  for the word director, you'll likely receive a lot of results for direct, direction, directions, and so on, too. Typing
  "director" (with quotation marks), however, will ensure that you only get results for that stem word.<p>
  If the search term is a phrase, your search will be for that specific phrase, rather than for all the component words
  as individual items. So, for example, if you search for the phrase director of human resources, without quotation
  marks, your search will return results based on all of the words in the phrase (except of, which is a stop word.)
  <p>
  Surrounding the term with quotation marks, however, will generate results that feature this specific term.<p>
 <b> 5. Remove Unhelpful Words</b><p>
  Inserting a hyphen/small dash/minus sign immediately before a word excludes it from a search.<p>
  So imagine, for example, that you're looking to find out more about marketing. However, you want to concentrate
  on traditional marketing techniques, whereas the internet appears to be full of references to digital and social
  media marketing, all of which are appearing in your search.<p>
  Typing in marketing -digital will exclude digital from the search, making it easier for you to find the information
  you're looking for. Typing marketing -digital -social would allow you to get rid of even more clutter.
  <p>
    <b>7. Avoid Search Pitfalls</b><p>

When searching online, it's important to bear in mind that many companies now have staff who are dedicated to 

improving their visibility online. They constantly tweak the wording of their websites to match the most commonly 
used keywords – a process known as Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
  <p>
As a result, the sites listed at the top of your search results may have very good SEO, but it doesn't necessarily 
follow that they'll have the best content. So, even when you've put in the best search terms you can, it's often 
worth digging down through your search results to find the best information.
<p>
With so much information now at your disposal, you need to be savvy about what is authoritative, and what is 
merely opinionated. Some blogs, for example, rank highly without actually being written by accredited experts. 
So, check carefully that the author of any information you use is well-regarded, and preferably associated with an 
academic institution, a professional body, or a reputable news organization.<p>
It's also worth being aware of paid advertisements, which can appear at the top of search engine listings because 
companies have paid for them to do so. These are simply designed to sell to you, which is fine if you're looking to 
buy, but can be a hindrance to general search.
